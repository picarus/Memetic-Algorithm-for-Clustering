Dear students,

Here you will find some information about your proposals for the term
project. I have tried to compile all that I know and have inserted a
preliminary title (just for reference). I make all information public
because I think it will be of interest for the whole class.

All errors or omissions are entirely my fault. Please tell me.

There are three kinds of status:

OK means your proposal is accepted and you can go ahead the best and fastest
you can.

IN PROCESS means either the proposal is accepted with some concerns (I
expect that you consider them and send me a revised proposal asap) or
you asked for one of the available projects (then simply pick one and
notify me).

UNKNOWN means I have not yet received an email from you, either with a
proposal or simply asking for one of the available projects.

There are just three available projects (two in neural networks and
one in genetic algorithms); all three are far from being trivial. I am
posting two now; a third will follow tomorrow. There is absolutely no
problem on forming teams of two people, so get in touch with one
another!

Finally notice that Angela will produce soon an additional project on
Fuzzy Systems, so if you are interested, it would be better you
contact her asap!

best,
Llu√≠s
