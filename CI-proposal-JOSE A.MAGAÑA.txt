CI project proposal: Memetic Algorithms(MA) applied to clustering 
=================================================================
The objective of the project will be the implementation and evaluation of a new MA applied to clustering of networks.
This algorithm will combine two existing algorithms: COMB-MA and MEME-NET, taking from each of them their simpler parts.
In the case of COMB-MA the x-over operator and in the case of MEME-NET the population initialization method.
The mutation will be defined to compensate for the lack of exploration or explotation that, mainly, the x-over may introduce.
As an additional improvement, the x-over operator will be modified to apply some domain knowledge on clustering, i.e. use of individual cluster modularity. The use of informed criteria (vs. random ) in the x-over operator is a research topic but not many papers exist on the literature. MA are focused on the mutation phase.
The emphasis will be on keeping all the algorithms simple (linear complexity) except for the calculus required to "inform" the x-over, Q modularity.
 
Genetic algorithm scheme(summary)
---------------------------------
initialization: alpha random joint of neighbours (MEME-NET)
selection: will be fix and chosen among the two options proposed
x-over: random choice of parents clusters (COMB-MA) with GPX (greedy partition x-over) --> apply modularity for each cluster + GPX
mutation: as required to keep exploration-explotation compensated
replacement : will be fix and chosen among the two options proposed (as required to keep population size constant)

Evaluation
----------
Being clustering an unsupervised method depending on the nature of the problem, the performance of the algorithm can not be measured following the Train-Validate-Test approach common in other ML techniques. Instead, the algorithms, stochastic by definition (initialization and mutation in our scheme) will be executed a large number of times and for each execution some metrics will be obtained:
* modularity and mutual information, as a measure of the clustering quality and similarity with the known ground truth(when available)
* execution time and number of generations, as a measure of the algorithm computational performance
From the data collected, an statistical relevance test of the results will be made (avg, std, max, t-test) and analyzed.
The datasets to benchmark the algorithm versus the references will be chosen among the used in the papers to report results, that in addition are well known datasets: Karate Club, Dolphins, US political books... At least one simple dataset and one more complex dataset will be evaluated. 

Tools
-----
No framework library on GA will be used. The language will be either Java or Python (using the NetworkX library probably).
