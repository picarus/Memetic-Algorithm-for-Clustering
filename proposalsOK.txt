SWARM INTELLIGENCE FOR COUNTING THE DEGREES OF SEPARATION IN TWITTER
Àlex Pardo and David Sánchez

Status: OK
Comments: Very interesting topic. Do not try to confirm the rule too
much, just do the project and see what comes out ...

CONWAY’S GAME OF LIFE THROUGH A GENETIC ALGORITHM
Stefan Ruseti

Status: OK
Comments: Quite interesting, but needs a clear specification of
project goals. Also a small theoretical study?

GENETIC ALGORITHMS IN THE GENERATION OF NORMS OF A VIRTUAL COMMUNITY
Iosu Mendizabal and Tobias Faass

Status: OK
Comments: Needs (and critically depends on) a useful specification of
how to check validity of the norms, but probably you know how to
handle this

OBTENTION OF GOOD DISCRIMINANT FEATURES TO STUDY LINGUISTIC VARIATION
IN ARAB DOCUMENTS 
Miguel Betanzos

Status: OK 
Comments: Feature selection is a hot and diverse topic. It
can be carried out with ANNs/GAs or using filters before
discrimination takes place. I have some experience on this (maybe I
can be of help in its application to the current corpus). Notice also
that different targets (authors, literary genres, times, ...) may
require different features

A SYSTEM FOR AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO ROBOTICS
Albert Busqué and Marc Bolaños

Status: OK 
Comments: Very interesting topic. My only concern is about
speed. Probably the system needs to work in real time. Can the
Evolutionary Algorithm meet this requirement? Can you make the system
fully adaptive (i.e. react in real-time to changes in goals: where do
the robot has to move)?

IDENTIFYING SEXUAL PREDATOR BEHAVIOR IN CHAT CONVERSATIONS
Claudia Elena Cardei

Status: OK 
Comments: Very exciting topic. It is also a delicate one. You should
try not to raise false alarms (false positives) and at the same time
not to bypass real threats (false negatives). This is really a machine
learning topic and seems far from trivial (unbalanced classes? small
sample sizes?). Rather than comparing the accuracy of different
methods, may I suggest to focus in one of them (say, the SVM) and try
to come up with the best possible model? Better than state-of-the-art?

MEMETIC ALGORITHMS APPLIED TO CLUSTERING
José A. Magaña

Status: OK 
Comments: We already talked about it. Just remember my advice on a
step by step analysis so you can assess the changes in performance and
hopefully link them to the different decisions

NEURAL NETWORKS APPLIED TO COMPUTER VISION
Pablo Pardo and Jeroni Carandell

Status: IN PROCESS 
Comments: If you are able to get some data from your CV subject, then
we can generate a viable project. There is one available project in
object recognition (CIFAR). Please get in touch with me if you feel it.

<ONE OF THE AVAILABLE CI PROJECTS>
Nils Kunze

Status: IN PROCESS 
Comments: OK. The list of available projects will be ready this
week. Please choose one (Ninja packing?) and let me know. Thanks!

<ONE OF THE AVAILABLE CI PROJECTS> or
GALAXY CLASSIFICATION WITH NEURAL NETWORKS
Anna Guitart

Status: IN PROCESS 
Comments: OK. The topic of galaxy classification looks very exciting
to me (I come from machine learning, I can give you some advice if
needed), and if you have real data this would make a wonderful
project. Just a bit worried about the big amount of previous
work. Although you are not required to do a research project,
obviously you need to consult previous (very) related work. Otherwise
you can choose one of the available projects and let me know

COMPARISON OF THE MLP AND WAVELET NETWORKS FOR STOCK MARKET INDEX FORECASTING
Jordi Rosés

Status: IN PROCESS 
Comments: OK. We already talked about it. Just consider that you do
not need to use your own implementation. I prefer that you attack the
problem with reliable software and do a nice study than to struggle
with your code and do not get a project at all.

COMPARISON BETWEEN SWARM INTELLIGENCE AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION IN SENSE OF USAGE AREAS AND ADVANTAGES
Koray Kayır

Status: IN PROCESS 
Comments: Not sure. Your proposal seems a bit oversized for a term
project. Theoretical approaches get very complicated and would make a
PhD thesis. Usage areas, strengths, weaknesses, and advantages are not
easy to isolate and I do not want you to end up writing a "compilation
of papers" project. Please re-think it and simplify the scope.

AUTOMATIC PLAYLIST GENERATION USING EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS
Filip Manisor

Status: OK
Comments: Nice topic, quite modern! Not sure whether genetic
algorithms fit this problem so well ... (just because they handle
bitstrings is not enough). I am also worried about the fitness
function: it should be automatizable and the less subjective possible
(otherwise it will be a noisy one, well, maybe this is better in this
case). Be sure to compare against previous work, and be original!

<ONE OF THE AVAILABLE CI PROJECTS>
Javier Poveda

Status: IN PROCESS 
Comments: There is a project available on object recognition (CIFAR,
maybe you can take it.

AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ERROR CORRECTING CODES
AND NEURAL NETWORKS
Lorenzo Candeago and Denis Ergashbaev

Status: OK
Comments: Very interesting topic. Please try to keep it manageable and
do not work in an isolated way! Otherwise the theoretical and
practical parts will have little relation!

CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION USING NEURAL NETWORKS
Daniel Horowitz and Rodrigo Weffer

Status: IN PROCESS 
Comments: Good topic, also very useful in practice. You critically
depend on the quality of the databases. I do not know what kind of
neural networks you are going to use. Please specify.

NEURAL NETWORKS FOR THE OTHELLO GAME
Andreas Roessler

Status: IN PROCESS
Comments: We already talked about it. Your project is far from
trivial, there maybe a lot of critical decisions that will affect the
quality of your system (like kind of neural network, how to generate
training data, etc). Please submit a more detailed proposal. Please
look hard for previous work.

STUDY ON USING OR DISCARDING EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM ON NEURAL
NETWORK WEIGHTS
Gerard Canal and Daniel Padilla

Status: IN PROCESS 
Comments: Your proposal seems very oversized for a term project (and
oversized in general). I have some experience on this topic and it
will probably exceed your time and efforts. I suggest that you
concentrate on ONE issue (learning speed, problem hardness, influence
of sample size, criticality of parameter values, number of inputs,
etc) and study it. You can design an artificial problem specifically
for that issue. Please refer to the "Tips for Experimental Work"
guide! Python (with or without Knime) is OK.

CRIMINAL PREDICTIVE PATTERNS USING NEURAL NETWORK TECHNIQUES WITH A GIS APPROACH
Pedro Robles

Status: OK
Comments: Good idea. My only concern is about the specific kinds of
neural networks you plan to use. Supervised/unupervised, or both?
Moreover, the papers you attach bear only an indirect relation with your
proposal.

<ONE OF THE AVAILABLE CI PROJECTS>
Alvise Memo

Status: IN PROCESS
Comments: I think we talked about it in class. I do not consider
heuristic search algorithms (like A*) a valid CI topic (this is purely
AI). Regarding neural networks for recognizing handwritten letters,
there is a project available on object recognition (CIFAR), maybe you
can take it or make a specific proposal.

<ONE OF THE AVAILABLE CI PROJECTS>
U. Kibongui

Comments: you mentioned a project related to neural networks. Please
choose one (CIFAR or Titanic) and let me know. Thanks!
