CI project proposal: Memetic Algorithms(MA) applied to clustering 
=================================================================
The objective of the project will be the implementation and evaluation of a new MA applied to clustering of networks.
This algorithm will combine two existing algorithms: COMB-MA and MEME-NET, taking from each of them their simpler parts.
In the case of COMB-MA the x-over operator and in the case of MEME-NET the population initialization method.
The mutation will be defined to compensate for the lack of exploration or explotation that, mainly, the x-over may introduce.
As an additional improvement, the x-over operator will be modified to apply some domain knowledge on clustering, i.e. use of individual cluster modularity. The use of informed criteria (vs. random ) in the x-over operator is a research topic but not many papers exist on the literature. MA are focused on the mutation phase.
The emphasis will be on keeping all the algorithms simple (linear complexity) except for the calculus required to "inform" the x-over, Q modularity.
 

Genetic algorithm scheme
------------------------
initialization: alpha random joint of neighbours (MEME-NET)
selection: will be fix and chosen among the two options proposed
x-over: random choice of parents clusters (COMB-MA) + (GPX: greedy partition x-over, maybe modified) --> apply modularity for each cluster 
mutation: as required to keep exploration-explotation compensated
replacement : will be fix and chosen among the two options proposed

Evaluation
----------
Being clustering an unsupervised method depending on the nature of the problem, the performance of the algorithm can not be measured following the Train-Validate-Test approach common in other ML techniques. Instead, the algorithms, stochastic by definition (initialization and mutation in our scheme) will be executed a large number of times and for each execution some metrics will be obtained:
* modularity and mutual information, as a measure of the clustering quality and similarity with the known ground truth(when available)
* execution time and number of executions, as a measure of the algorithm computational performance

From the data collected, an statistical relevance test of the results will be made and analyzed.

The datasets to benchmark the algorithm versus the references will be chosen among the used in the papers to report results, that in addition are well known datasets: Karate Club, Dolphins, US political books... At least one simple dataset and one more complex dataset will be evaluated.




---------------------------
take optimal solution: mutate in all possible manners.
For all those manners calculate Q and calculate all possible muations, see how good are them.


MEMETIC ALGORITHMS APPLIED TO CLUSTERING
José A. Magaña

Status: OK 
Comments: We already talked about it. Just remember my advice on a
step by step analysis so you can assess the changes in performance and
hopefully link them to the different decisions


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
No TVT approach

Clustering: unsupervised
Leave out strategies affect the problem to solve.

Highly parameterized: population size, iteration number, convergence ratio (Q)
Run N times, report max, avg, std.

Trying to reproduce COMB-MA is out of the scope, since the algorithms used are complex (BGLL). In the case of MEME-NET, complexity is lower so, if time permits and there are doubts

Take 2 or 3 of the networks (few nodes: karate:unweighted, dophins:weighted)
