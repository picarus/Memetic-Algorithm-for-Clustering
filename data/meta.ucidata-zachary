description: Memberâ€“member ties
long-description: This is the well-known Zachary karate club network. The data was collected from the members of a university karate club by Wayne Zachary in 1977. Each node represents a member of the club, and each edge represents a tie between two members of the club. This is a classical social network dataset from the literature. The network is very small: it has 34 vertices and 78 undirected edges.
